        <h1>My map of RC car places, mostly near Horsforth/Leeds</h1>
        
        <p>This is my personal map of good places to run my RC cars. I haven't verified every one. Feel free to suggest some more. </p>
        
        <p>Maybe add them to this MSUK forum post: <a href="https://www.msuk-forum.co.uk/forums/topic/230066-post-your-regular-bashing-spots-in-leeds/">Post your regular bashing spots in leeds</a> and/or tag me <a href="https://www.msuk-forum.co.uk/profile/54734-andrew-tatham/">@Andrew Tatham</a></p>
                
        <h2>Off road</h2>
        <p>Anywhere good for a rip with a basher, like my Rival MT10</p> 

        <h2>On road / car parks</h2>
        <p>Anywhere good for hooning an Arrma Infraction 3S BLX or similar</p> 

        <h2>Avoiding</h2> 
        <ul>
            <li>Water. Lakes, Resevoirs, Canals</li>
            <li>Cemeteries, Memorials</li>
            <li>Any old quiet resedential street</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Disclaimer</h2>
        
        <p>Places appear because they looked good from sattelite imagery. No right to access is implied. May be considered trespass. Use at your own risk yada yada.</p>
